      <h2 i18n:translate="header_risk_aware">Are you aware of all the risks?</h2>
      <p i18n:translate="intro_risk_aware">Including the risks to your employees and your equipment?  What if there is an accident with one of the machines? What if an employee is exposed to hazardous substances? A risk assessment helps you to define these risks and tackle them head on. A risk assessment consists of two parts: a <em>list</em> with all the risks to your company and an <em>action plan</em> to deal with them. These two components allow you to limit the risks to your employees and your company, and therefore also the financial risk.</p>

      <h2 i18n:translate="header_not_complicated">The assessment is not complicated.</h2>
      <p i18n:translate="intro_not_complicated">Complicated? Not really. It just takes a bit of time. However, the RA is important. So important that the government has made it compulsory for almost all entrepreneurs with employees.</p>
